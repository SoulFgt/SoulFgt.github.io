   <p>Here are two pictures of a game that I like play called Fortnite Battle Royale.</p>
   
   <p>Fortnite is 100 player versus player game that is both competitive and fun to play. The point of the game is to be the last player alive out of the rest of 99 players. It also a free game, that offers in-game purchases. Above are pictures of in-game action that can be take place while playing.  </p>
